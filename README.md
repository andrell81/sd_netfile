This Python file contains functions for getting campaign finance transactions that candidates and committees are required to report to the City of San Diego Clerk. The final output includes transactions between election committees and financial supporters, such as loans, contributions of money, contributions of goods and services, and money spent independently to support a candidate or ballot measure.

Transactions come from electronic filings with the City of San Diego Clerkâ€™s office that are required by local and state campaign laws. Committees are required to report a variety of financial transactions, but the ones included here come from California Form 460 schedules A, B1, C and D as well as California Form 496 and California Form 497.

Netfile is the company that owns and operates the electronic filing system. For more information about the Netfile API, see Netfile on [Swagger](https://netfile.com/Connect2/api/swagger-ui/#!/public/Image).

For more information about local laws governing campaign finance transactions, see the City of San Diego [Ethics Commission](https://www.sandiego.gov/ethics/documents/candidate).

I wrote this Python code as part of the City of San Diego's Open Data program. Get more data on the City of San Diego [Open Data Portal](https://data.sandiego.gov/).
